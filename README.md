# Tinkering-Audio-COMP120 Assignment
The repository for our Tinkering Graphics assessment, by Joseph Spaul and Jamie Hilton.

This repository is for our work on the Tinking Audio assignment, from the COMP120 module of our Computing for Games course at Falmouth University. We have approached the tasks by each choosing which contract we will both undertake alone.

## Instructions

Unity Version 2018.4.2f (64-bit) is required in order to run both of these programs.
For contract 1, the relevant pieces of code reside in the "CaptureFish", "PlayerAiming" and "SlowFish" scripts. These scripts can be found in the Scripts folder of Joseph Spaul - Tinkering Audio. (Please note, I added my Tinkering Audio code to a project that I completed in a group previously and the "PlayerAiming" script was authored by Joseph Broughton)

## Contract 1 by Joseph Spaul

You are currently being tasked with creating a tool which will generate soundeffects, these should consist of sequences of tone as well as sample manipulations. The sound effect should be clearly tied to an action the player makes in the game (e.g., picking up an item, attacking, walking over a trap, or so on). An element of procedurality is expected to vary the tones.

## Contract 2 by Jamie Hilton

It has been decided that you need to make a tool which will generate ambient audio tracks to make the player feel like they are in different areas of the gameâ€™s setting. Think something like SyrinScape! A variety of settings that should be configurable by a designer and allow them to vary ambience of each level, ideally each zone within a level.

## Licensing Infromation 
We have chosen "GNU General Public Licence v3.0" this means that it allows anyone to use it, copyright free. This also allows anyone to do what they like with the code. Distributors whether free, or bought have a responsibility to make sure that the people who they are distributing it to are aware of the licensing agreement and are given full access to everything the distributers had access to. This licensing agreement allows anyone access to the program and change them as they wish, this means it's as open source as possible and allows the highest amount of access to as many people as possible. We have chosen the GNU License becasue we want to have a policy of share and share alike. GNU is different from other lincences. For instance, the MIT licence  requires the distributor to add a copy of the licence, along side a copyright notice to whomever they distribute the program to. While with GNU, the distributor must only provide the source code when they provide the program.

## References 

Contract 1:

Audio files used for sound effects are free assets from the Unity store and the internet. The Free assets I got were in the file "8-Bit Style Sound Effects". I only used two sounds from it and deleted the rest becasue I didnt need them. Seeing as the Assets are free and i'm not using this project for comercial purposes, i'm allowed to use thes assets. The "cash" sound that is played in the game was originally called "Till With Bell.wav", was downloaded from freesound.org and is credited to Benboncan. It's under the Attribution License, this allows me to build upon, distribute and adapt it to whatever I want. I could even distribute it commercially, but I could only do these things if I give credit to the original author of the file.
