# Tinkering-Audio-COMP120 Assignment
The repository for our Tinkering Graphics assessment, by Joseph Spaul and Jamie Hilton.

This repository is for our work for the Tinking Audio assignment, from the COMP120 module of our Computing for Games course at Falmouth University. We have approached the tasks by each choosing which contract we will both undertake.

## Instructions

Unity is required in order to run both of the programs.


## Contract 1
Contract 1 is being completed by Joseph Spaul

You are currently been tasked with creating a tool which will generate sound
effects, these should consist of sequences of tone as well as sample manipulations. The sound effect should be clearly tied to an action the player makes in
the game (e.g., picking up an item, attacking, walking over a trap, or so on).
An element of procedurality is expected to vary the tones.

## Contract 2
Contract 2 is being completed by Jamie Hilton

It has been decided that you need to make a tool which will generate ambient
audio tracks to make the player feel like they are in different areas of the
gameâ€™s setting. Think something like SyrinScape! A variety of settings that
should be configurable by a designer and allow them to vary ambience of
each level, ideally each zone within a level.
