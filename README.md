# Tinkering-Audio-COMP120 Assignment
The repository for our Tinkering Graphics assessment, by Joseph Spaul and Jamie Hilton.

This repository is for our work on the Tinking Audio assignment, from the COMP120 module of our Computing for Games course at Falmouth University. We have approached the tasks by each choosing which contract we will both undertake alone.

## Instructions

Unity Version 2018.4.2f (64-bit) is required in order to run both of these programs.


## Contract 1 by Joseph Spaul

You are currently being tasked with creating a tool which will generate soundeffects, these should consist of sequences of tone as well as sample manipulations. The sound effect should be clearly tied to an action the player makes in the game (e.g., picking up an item, attacking, walking over a trap, or so on). An element of procedurality is expected to vary the tones.

## Contract 2 by Jamie Hilton

It has been decided that you need to make a tool which will generate ambient audio tracks to make the player feel like they are in different areas of the gameâ€™s setting. Think something like SyrinScape! A variety of settings that should be configurable by a designer and allow them to vary ambience of each level, ideally each zone within a level.

## Licensing Infromation 
We have chosen "GNU General Public Licence v3.0" this means that it allows anyone to use it, copywrite free. This also allows anyone to do what they like with the code. Distributers whether free or paid have a responcibility to make sure that the people they are distributing it to are aware that the licensing agreement and are given full access to everything the distributers had access to. This licensing agreement allows anyone access to the program and change them as they wish, this means it's as open source as possible and allows the highest amount of access to as many people as possible. We have chosen the GNU License becasue we want to have a policy of share and share alike. GNU is different from other lincences. For instance, the MIT licence  requires the distributor to add a copy of the licence, along side a copyright notice to whomever they distribute the program to. While with GNU, the distributor must only provide the source code when they provide the program.
